## Challegens from two learning paths from docs.microsoft.com 
### 1. Add logic to your applications with C#
    - Build more complex and expressive Boolean expressions
    - Use code blocks to control variable scope and the execution path of your code
    - Branch the flow of code using the switch-case statement
    - Iterate through a code block with the for, while and do-while statements
### 2. Work with data in C#
    - Choose the correct data type for the type of data you need to work with
    - Cast and convert data from one type to another
    - Modify string data, formatting it for display or changing the content of the string
    - Manipulate arrays, adding, removing, and sorting data
